# 🎯 Real Time Object Detection

**Real Time Object Detection is a computer vision–based system designed to detect and classify objects from live camera feeds or video streams in real time. The system uses deep learning–based object detection models to identify multiple objects simultaneously with high accuracy and low latency. This project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning and image processing techniques in real-world scenarios such as surveillance, autonomous systems, and smart environments.**
